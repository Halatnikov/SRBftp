Known issues:
-The game might behave odd on monitors above 60hz
-There's no fallbacks if WebGL isn't supported by your device, so you'll have to look at water being wrong and the missing menu cursor
-If the game crashes upon starting or on intro screen, open "\SRBftp\savedata\SRBftp_Config.ini" and change "MiscDiscordRichPresence=1" to "MiscDiscordRichPresence=0"
-Android and Web versions are kinda half-assed
